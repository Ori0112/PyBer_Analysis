# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of our analysis was to perform an exploratory analysis where we would create several types of visualizations. To show the relationship between the city and the type of drivers, as well as, the percentage total fares, riders, drivers by type of city. The analysis and visualizations that would be produced are intended to help Pyber improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for under-served neighborhoods.

## Results

In the analysis we were comparing three different types of cities: urban, suburban, and rural. We were focused on comparing the amount rides in each type of city, amount of fares, the average cost of a fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. All of this ride-sharing data from PyBer would help us develop some insight and ideas on how to make ridesharing services more affordable in under-served neighborhoods.
